# Streamlit Dungeon Crawler

The concept of Streamlit refresh on each interaction refers to the way in which the Streamlit framework updates the page in response to user input. This feature can be used to create interactive applications, such as a dungeon crawling game, where the user interacts with the page and the page updates in real-time to reflect the changes.
